# harvard-cs50
This is my version of the source code for the Harvard CS50 course by edX.org

## Running this project
To get this project up and running you should start by installing Python3 on your computer. It's advised you create a virtual environment to store your projects dependencies separately. You can install virtualenv with

```
pip install virtualenv
```

Clone or download this repository and open it in your editor of choice. In a windows/mac/linux terminal, run the following command in the base directory of this project

```
virtualenv env
```

That will create a new folder `env` in your project directory. Next activate it with this command on mac/linux:

```
source env/bin/active
```

Then install the project dependencies with

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Install other dependencies
```
Git
Postgresql
SqlAlchemy
Docker
```

Now you're ready to follow the video tutorials.
